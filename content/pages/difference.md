    text: "Our crypto will do the following:\_​\n\n*   Confirm the identities of all individuals utilizing it.\_​(Sites like Coinbase whom already implement\_this today.​)\n\n*   Track all the transactions to provide a trail and prevent\_some of today’s issues such as:\_​\n\n*   Crime​\n\n*   Identify fraud​\n\n*   Help mitigate money laundering operations.​\n\n*   KYC data can be used to enhance services to our citizens.\n\nVaishCoin is not able to be artificially “Mined” like other cryptocurrencies, reducing the environmental impact compared to other coins.​\n\nVaishCoin also generates contracts when making transactions to provide legal documentation, release funds when a job is completed and keep both parties at the same advantage. ​\n"
